# Carnival-Gift-Shop

Carnival Gift Shop is a simple project that helped me deepen my basic JavaScript knowledge. 

With the help of this project you can buy various toys from the carnival shop. The products are: 

Teddy Bear :teddy_bear:, Big Red Ball :red_circle:, Huge Bear :bear:, Candy :candy:, Stuffed Tiger :tiger:, Stuffed Dragon :dragon:, Skateboard :skateboard:, Toy Car :racing_car:, Basketball :basketball:, Scary Mask :japanese_goblin:. 

You have 5 options to choose from:
- 1 - Buy a gift: If you have enough tickets, you can buy any gift you want. You can buy a product only once.
- 2 - Add tickets: If you realize you don't have enough tickets to buy gifts, you can add more (between 0 and 1000 tickets for each charge).
- 3 - Check tickets: You can check how many tickets you have at the moment.
- 4 - Show gifts: You can see once again what gifts are left to buy.
- 5 - Exit the shop: You'll exit the shop and, of course, the program.
